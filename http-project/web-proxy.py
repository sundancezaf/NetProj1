In the second part, you will build a web proxy server. It is a simple proxy which understands only
http GET requests and is able to cache web pages. As we learnt in our class, a web proxy sits
between a web client and a web server i.e., the client requests the objects via the proxy server. If
the proxy server does not already contain that object, it will forward request to the web server.
The web server will then generate a response message and deliver it to the proxy server, which
in turn sends it to the client (after caching in a copy for itself). Though in practice, the web proxy
must verify that the cached response is still valid and that it is the correct response to the
client's request, you can ignore these constrains for this exercise.
